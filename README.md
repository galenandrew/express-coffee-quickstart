# Express Coffee Quickstart
A really simple boilerplate that includes:
- Express
- Bunyan
- A Bluebird Promise-based connection pooling wrapper for MySQL

It's written in Coffeescript, too!

Just `npm install` and get to work!

## Recommendations
- Supervisor: It's great! It'll watch everything in your directory and make you
a super baller.
